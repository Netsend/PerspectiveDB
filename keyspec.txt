Key spec.

The following grammar specifies the keys used for storing each DAG and
related keys in a B-tree.

Basic Types

The following basic types are used as terminals in the rest of the grammar. Each
type must be serialized in little-endian format.

""      empty string
byte    1 byte (8-bits)


Non-terminals

The following specifies the rest of the key grammar. Note that quoted strings
represent terminals, and should be interpreted with C semantics (e.g. "\x01"
represents the byte 0000 0001). Also note that we use the * operator as
shorthand for repetition (e.g. ("\x01"*2) is "\x01\x01"). When used as a unary
operator, * means that the repetition can occur 0 or more times.

key     ::=  name subkey ""       any key is a name followed by a subkey
name    ::=  string               name of the key space
subkey  ::=
  |       "\x01" id ival          dskey, data store key
  |       "\x02" ival             ikey, i index key
  |       "\x03" id version       headkey, head index key
  |       "\x04" version          vkey, version index key
ival    ::=  lbeint               i value, local monotonically increasing number
id      ::=  string               used to identify dskey values
version ::=  lbeint               version number
lbeint  ::=  byte (byte*)         Large int - The byte is the number of bytes in
                                  (byte*). The (byte*) is one to 254 bytes written
                                  that should be interpreted as an unsigned
                                  integer in big endian format.
string  ::=  byte (byte*) "\x00"  String - The byte is the number bytes in the
                                  (byte*) + 1 (for the trailing '\x00'). The
                                  (byte*) is zero or more UTF-8 encoded
                                  characters. Can be at most 254 bytes.


The values for the given keys are as follows:
key: "\x01", value: BSON serialized javascript object
key: "\x02", value: key of subtype "\x03"
key: "\x03", value: key of subtype "\x02"
key: "\x04", value: key of subtype "\x01"
